# Black Box diagnosis results

Three pipelines on the same runs: **Baseline (previous signals)** (the 25 earlier signals, model score only), **New signals, no reranker** (all 32 signals, model score only), and **Black Box model** (32 signals + decisive-evidence reranker; this is what `/diagnose` serves).

Simulated runs come from `sim_agent.py`; framework `crewai` and model `mistral` are held out entirely and train and test never share a source run. REAL runs come from Part 1's recorder (`blackbox_part 1/runs`, models: groq:openai/gpt-oss-120b, mock-large, mock-small). Real runs are split by task: 163 runs on training tasks, 124 independent runs on held-out tasks. Features, reranker and threshold were chosen by cross-validation inside the training tasks; held-out tasks are only scored.

## Validation (how the choices were made)

Grouped 5-fold cross-validation over the 163 real training runs: each fold holds out whole tasks, the model is trained on the simulated runs plus the other folds. 163 out-of-fold runs.

| Pipeline | Runs | Top-1 | Top-3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline (previous signals) | 163 | 91.4% | 98.2% |
| New signals, no reranker | 163 | 97.5% | 99.4% |
| Black Box model | 163 | 99.4% | 100.0% |

Flag threshold, on the same out-of-fold scores (a step is flagged when its score reaches the threshold):

| Threshold | Baseline P | Baseline R | Baseline F1 | Final P | Final R | Final F1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.3 | 61.9% | 93.9% | 74.6% | 92.1% | 100.0% | 95.9% |
| 0.5 (old) | 70.3% | 91.4% | 79.5% | 94.8% | 100.0% | 97.3% |
| 0.6 | 74.6% | 90.2% | 81.7% | 96.4% | 100.0% | 98.2% |
| 0.7 | 76.8% | 89.6% | 82.7% | 98.2% | 100.0% | 99.1% |
| 0.8 (chosen) | 83.3% | 85.9% | 84.6% | 98.8% | 100.0% | 99.4% |
| 0.9 | 91.9% | 76.1% | 83.2% | 99.4% | 100.0% | 99.7% |
| 0.95 | 95.0% | 69.3% | 80.1% | 99.4% | 98.2% | 98.8% |

Chosen threshold: 0.8. The final pipeline's F1 is flat between 0.7 and 0.9 on validation, so the middle of that range was taken instead of the single best value.

## Precision, recall, F1 and confusion matrix (per step, held-out data)

Every step is one decision. Each run has exactly one truly faulty step.

Rows: kind of the truly faulty step. Columns: what was ranked first.

| Faulty step is a | right step | wrong step, model_call | wrong step, tool_call | wrong step, decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| model_call | 209 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| tool_call | 254 | 0 | 17 | 1 |

## Unseen failure types (final pipeline)

For each row the model is retrained with that fault type removed from training, then tested only on runs with that fault. "Seen" is the normal model, which had examples of it.

74 runs confirmed by the verify loop were added to a simulated-only model, labelled with the step replay confirmed (not the injected label). Tested on held-out runs (simulated unseen setup, plus real held-out runs when given) whose task or source run is not among the added ones.
